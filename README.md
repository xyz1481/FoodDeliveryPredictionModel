# 🚀 Delivery Time Prediction Model  

## 📌 Overview  
This project predicts food delivery times based on various factors using machine learning. The model analyzes delivery distance, traffic conditions, restaurant type, and other variables to provide accurate delivery time estimates.  

## ✨ Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts relevant features to improve prediction accuracy.  
- **Model Training**: Implements and compares different ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Uses R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for validation.  
- **Visualization**: Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib for data analysis.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔧 Installation Instructions  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeliveryTimePrediction.git
cd DeliveryTimePrediction
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)  
```sh
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux  
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows  
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, manually install dependencies:  
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook  
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
Open **DeliveryTime.ipynb** and run the cells to execute the model.

## 📊 Model Performance  
The model's performance is evaluated using:  
- **R² Score**: Measures how well the model fits the data.  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Quantifies prediction errors.  

## 📌 Future Improvements  
- Improve model accuracy using Deep Learning approaches.  
- Integrate real-time traffic data for better predictions.  
- Deploy as a web application for user interaction.
